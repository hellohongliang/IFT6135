# IFT6135
Implement RNN, GRU and attention module of a transormer network using pytorch tensor operations. models.py includs all model classes
and ptb-lm includes main function and hyper paramenters. 

seq_prediction.py calls generate functions of RNN and GRU models to generate a sentence of a given length when the first word is 
given as the input.
